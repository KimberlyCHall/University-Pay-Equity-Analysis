# University Pay Equity Analysis
This project consists of t-test analysis of anonymized salary data at the University of Houston-Clear Lake from the year 2020.
If trying to make sense of lists of numbers isn't your favorite thing, I have included my written report on this project, including a thorough literature review and in-depth discussion of the data.
